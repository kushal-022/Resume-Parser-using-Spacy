# Resume_parser

Resume Parser is a program designed to automate the task of extracting key information from resumes. With this program, you can easily and quickly extract information such as candidate name, email, phone number, education, work experience, and skills from a resume.

The project has been developed by the ADG team, which consists of @harshitsarda, @Izhan-07, and @kushal-022.

## What is a Resume Parser?

A resume parser is a deep learning/AI framework that identifies complete information from resumes, analyzes, store, organize, and enriches it through its taxonomies. Resume parsing software makes the hiring process quick and more productive.

Fast and accurate resume parsing technology improves efficiency and offers an enhanced candidate experience.

It is a component that automatically segregates the information into various fields and parameters like contact information, educational qualification, work experience, skills, achievements, professional certifications to quickly help you identify the most relevant resumes based on your criteria.

A parser takes input in the form of a sequence of program instructions and tends to build a data structure, a "parse tree," or an abstract syntax tree.

## Getting Started
To use the Resume Parser, you will need to download the code from our GitHub repository and install the required dependencies. We have included a requirements.txt file that lists all the necessary libraries.

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the program by executing the "resume_parser.py" file. This will launch the program, and you can begin parsing resumes.

## How to Use
To use the Resume Parser, you will need to provide it with one or more resumes in PDF format. The program will extract key information from the resume and store it in a CSV file.

## To get started, follow these steps:

Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the "resume_parser.py" file by executing the following command: python resume_parser.py.
Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to input the path to the resume file(s) you want to parse.
The program will extract the information from the resumes and store it in a CSV file named "resume_data.csv".
Limitations
The Resume Parser is designed to work with resumes in PDF format only. It may not be able to extract information from resumes in other formats.

Also, the program may not be able to accurately extract information from resumes that have unusual layouts or formatting.
